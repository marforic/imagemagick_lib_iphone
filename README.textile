<h1>Compiled downloads</h1>

You can grab the latest compiled ImageMagick directly from their <a href="ftp://magick.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/iOS/">ftp</a> or any mirror.

There is always 2 packages for the compiled ImageMagick:
* iPhoneMagick-VERSION-libs.zip
* iPhoneMagick-VERSION.zip

The first one includes headers and compiled libraries that have been used to compile ImageMagick. Most users would need this one.

<h1>ImageMagick compiling script for iPhone OS and iPhone Simulator</h1>

To run the script:
<pre>
	./imagemagick_compile.sh VERSION
</pre>
where VERSION is the version of ImageMagick you want to compile (i.e.: 6.6.8-5, svn, ...)

This script will compile ImageMagick as a static library to be included in iPhone projects
Support for:
* png
* jpeg
* tiff

Upon successful compilation a folder called "IMPORT_ME" will be created from where you start the script: you can import it into your XCode project

<h2>XCode project settings</h2>

After including everything into XCode please also make sure to have these settings (Build tab of the project information):
